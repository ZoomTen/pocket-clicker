## Mimics icc for compiling. Its purpose is to discern between
## C sources and ASM sources and makes it somewhat manageable.
##
## Calls sdcc and sdld directly. Same kinda hack as link.nims.
##
## Compilation is slow, but I guess that's the kinda
## price to pay for *full* control over the C compiler invocation.
